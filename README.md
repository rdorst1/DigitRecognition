# DigitRecognition

To try out the number recognition you have to use several commands for it to work.

First of all you have to setup a virtual environment:

#### py -m venv env

To make sure you are using the latest version of pip:

#### py -m pip install --upgrade pip

After this you'll have to install several packages(which may take some time)

#### py -m pip install imageio numpy keras matplotlib tensorflow 


To train the models run the models Model1.py, Model2.py and Model3.py. Or use the pretrained models included in this repository.

To recognize a digit run the test.py file. In that file you can change which number you want to try to recognize.
